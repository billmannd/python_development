Major Points: 

Booleans: 
    a data type whose value is "True" or "False"
    
    Boolean operators: compare two (or more) values in order to determine how
    a program should proceed. 
        Examples: 
  operator | operator word form | use in sentence w/ response        | code, output
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        == | "equals"           | "Is pie delicious? Yes"            | pie == delicious, True 
        != | "does not equal"   | "Is pie not delicious? No"         | pie != delicious, False
        >  | "greater than"     | "Is 7 bigger than 7 > 4? Yes"      | 7 > 4, True 
        <  | "less than"        | "Is 7 less than 7 < 4? No"         | 7 < 4, False
        >= | "greater or equal" | "Is 7 bigger than/equal to 4? Yes" | 7 >= 7, True
        <= | "less or equal"    | "Is 7 less than/equal to 99? Yes"  | 7 <= 99, True



Conditionals: statements which allow you to compare two or more things and
perform actions based on the conditional statements. 

they are in the following syntax

if <variable or value> <conditional (see above)> <other variable(s) or value(s)>: 
    <perform action> 
    actions might be "print a value", multiply two numbers, hit a web server, etc

elif <variable or value> <conditional (see above)> <other variable or value>:
    *elif is an abbreviation for "else if"
    it still needs to compare two or more  values 
    still performs actions
    you can have multiple elif statements between an "if" and "else" statement
else: 
    else doesn't need to declare anything. It is saying "if none of the above 
    condition(s) are met, then we're gonna do this

Functions: 

We can go over this another time, conditionals are a lot already. I included 
some documentation if you want to look into it on your own.
